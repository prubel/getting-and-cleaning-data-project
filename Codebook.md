The measurements in average-by-subject-and-activity.txt follow the
data described in the features_info.txt data from the original datafile:

In addition to fields described in that file, there are two additional
fields:

* subject:
this column contains a number specifying which participant the
measurement belong to.

* activity: 
a factor of 6 values one of either: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, or LAYING.
